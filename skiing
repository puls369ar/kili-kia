# Expenses and Finances for Skiing`
* Ski Options - Free 
* Place to Stay - Yet to Find
* SkiPass - HalfDay(10:30-13:30)=5000(2024 Data) => 2 Weeks (10 days) = 50000
* HelmetPrice + GogglePrice - + 11700

OVERALL: Without Place to Stay - 75000








# Conclusion 
I need to end the probation period at the office to make Scenario2 work
Show good performance NOV30 - DEC30 to have a word for two weeks of remote work during the skiing season in January
